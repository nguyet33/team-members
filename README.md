# team-members

## User Story
```md
AS A manager
I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles
```
## Description
The motivation behind this project was the beginning to learn the back-end of the fullstack WebDev. In this particular assignement, we learn how to use node.js to install certain packages that will allows programers to directly use javascript to code the back-end of things isntead of for the browswer like we have been doing. Also, we leared about tests and writing tests before coding to fabricate the results we needed and ensure that it works correctly. We use Node.js command line to generate and HTML file that allows a users to add team members based on the questions asked. 

This solves the need to create an HTML file along with new questions prompt everytime. 

## Acceptance Criteria
```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information
THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
WHEN I click on the GitHub username
THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
WHEN I start the application
THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
WHEN I select the engineer option
THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I select the intern option
THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I decide to finish building my team
THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated

```

## My Task
To create a README file using only node.js 

## Installation
Begin at the GitHub repository that holds the code:
https://github.com/nguyet33/team-members

Once you are at the correct repo, click on the green "<> Code" button and select "SSH" under the "Local" tab.

Copy the SSH key to your clipboard and navigate to your terminal.

Once you are in your terminal, navigate to the directory of which you would like to clone this repository.

When you are at the destination you would like to clone, follow through with the git cloning procedures as you would normally.

For Windows: git clone "key that was copied to your clipboard" --> Enter

## Usage
Input the desire team information to create an HTML file in the asset folder. Then from there, you can run the system in your prefer browser to see the resutls.
